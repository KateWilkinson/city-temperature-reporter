# City Temperature Reporter

This is a kata for thinking about how we might stub a program's call to an external API. Inspiration for it came from [another kata](https://github.com/MA-Codejam/round-three-feb-20), originally conceived for a Makers Academy CodeJam. See that kata's readme for a description of the problem.
